A helpful dictionary of messages that can be sent or received during a bUE mission time.

When sending a message, you should pass this to the AT command terminal:
    AT+SEND=<recv address>,<payload length>,<MESSAGE TYPE><:BODY (optional)>
On the receiver side, you will see the incoming message as
    +RCV=<sndr address>,<payload length>,<MESSAGE TYPE><:BODY (optional)>,<RSSI>,<SNR>

In python, these are done in the following way:
    Sending a message:      self.ota.send_ota_message(<recv address>, "<MESSAGE TYPE><:BODY (optional)>")
    Receiving a message:    new_messages = self.ota.get_new_messages()
                            ^ becomes a list of messages of form "+RCV=<sndr address>,<payload length>,<MESSAGE TYPE><:BODY (optional)>,<RSSI>,<SNR>"

In the example for each of the messages, assume the bUE has an OTA id of 5, and the base station has an OTA id of 10.

REQ:
    Direction: bUE -> base
    Meaning: The bUE is requesting that it join the OTA network and shares its hostname and Reyax Id. It is broadcast over the ota, so it sends to address 0
    Body: None
    Example: (bue_main.py) self.ota.send_ota_message(0, "REQ:<hostname>,<bUE_id>")
    Response: The base station will respond with a CON message

CON:
    Direction: base -> bUE
    Meaning: The base station is confirming that the bUE has joined the OTA network while transmitting its own.
             The base station also sends its current time so the bUE can correct its own clock if needed (will correct if > 1 second difference)
    Body: base station id
    Example: (base_station_main.py) self.ota.send_ota_message(5, "CON:10")
    Response: The bUE will respond with a ACK message

ACK:
    Direction: bUE -> base
    Meaning: The bUE lets the base station know that it has received the connect message
    Body: None
    Example: (bue_main.py) self.ota.send_ota_message(10, "ACK")
    Response: None

PING:
    Direction: bUE -> base
    Meaning: The bUE periodically pings the base station
    Body: None
    Example: (bue_main.py) self.ota.send_ota_message(10, PING:<self.cur_st.value>,<lat>,<long>) NOTE: lat, long are '' if GPS isn't working
    Response: The base station will respond with a PINGR. If too much time passes between PINGR's, the bUE knows it has become disconnected from the network.

PINGR:
    Direction: base -> bUE
    Meaning: The base station is responding to the PING. If both PING and PINGR occur regularly, the bUE is connected to the base station.
    Body: None
    Example: (bue_main.py) self.ota.send_ota_message(5, "PINGR")
    Response: None

TEST:
    Direction: base -> bUE
    Meaning: The base station sends a UTW test configuration, a file, a start time, and parameters.
    Body: <file>,<start_time>,<parameters>
    Example: (bue_main.py) self.ota.send_ota_message(5, TEST:<file>,<start_time>,<parameters>)
    Response: The bUE will respond with a TESTR, confirming that it has received the test 

FAIL: 
    Direction: bUE -> base
    Meaning: The bUE receieved a TEST from the base station, but there was something wrong with it, and the test will not run
    Body: TBH (possibly the reason why there was a failure)
    Example: (bue_main.py) self.ota.send_ota_message(10, "FAIL:BAD_CONFIG")
    Response: None

CANC:
    Direction: base -> bUE
    Meaning: If the user needs to terminate a test for any reason, they can send this while the bUE is in the test state.
             If the bUE is in any other state it should have no effect
    Body: None
    Example: (base_station_main.py) self.send_ota_message(5, "CANC")
    Response: None (bUE should start sending PINGs again)


PREPR:
    Direction: bUE -> base
    Meaning: The bUE lets the base station know that it has received the UTW test message and confirms the start time
    Body: <starttime>
    Example: (bue_main.py) self.ota.send_ota_message(10, "TESTR:1745004290")
    Response: None

TOUT:
    Direction: bUE -> base
    Meaning: The bUE sends stdout/stderr from its UTW test
    Body: <stdout>
    Example: (bue_main.py) self.ota.send_ota_message(10, "TOUT:<stdout>")
    Response: None

DONE:
    Direction: bUE -> base
    Meaning: The bUE lets the base station know that it has finished its UTW test; it will now enter the idle state and send pings again.
    Body: None
    Example: (bue_main.py) self.ota.send_ota_message(10, "DONE")
    Response: None

RELOAD:
    Direction: base -> bUE
    Meaning: The base station tells the bUE to restart its bue.service
    Body: None
    Example: (base_station_main.py) self.ota.send_ota_message(10, "RELOAD")
    Response: None

RESTART: 
    Direction: base -> bUE
    Meaning: The base station tells the bUE to completely restart (sudo reboot)
    Body: None
    Example: (base_station_main.py) self.ota.send_ota_message(10, "RESTART")
    Reponse: None
