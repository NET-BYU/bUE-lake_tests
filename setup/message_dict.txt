A helpful dictionary of messages that can be sent or received during a bUE mission time.

When sending a message, you should pass this to the AT command terminal:
    AT+SEND=<recv address>,<payload length>,<MESSAGE TYPE><:BODY (optional)>
On the receiver side, you will see the incoming message as
    +RCV=<sndr address>,<payload length>,<MESSAGE TYPE><:BODY (optional)>,<RSSI>,<SNR>

In python, these are done in the following way:
    Sending a message:      self.ota.send_ota_message(<recv address>, "<MESSAGE TYPE><:BODY (optional)>")
    Receiving a message:    new_messages = self.ota.get_new_messages()
                            ^ becomes a list of messages of form "+RCV=<sndr address>,<payload length>,<MESSAGE TYPE><:BODY (optional)>,<RSSI>,<SNR>"

In the example for each of the messages, assume the bUE has an OTA id of 5, and the base station has an OTA id of 10.

REQ:
    Direction: bUE -> base
    Meaning: The bUE is requesting that it join the OTA network and shares its name. It is broadcast over the ota, so it sends to address 0
    Body: None
    Example: (bue_main.py) self.ota.send_ota_message(0, "REQ:Perry")
    Response: The base station will respond with a CON message

CON:
    Direction: base -> bUE
    Meaning: The base station is confirming that the bUE has joined the OTA network while transmitting its own .
    Body: base station id
    Example: (base_station_main.py) self.ota.send_ota_message(5, "CON:10")
    Response: The bUE will respond with a ACK message

ACK:
    Direction: bUE -> base
    Meaning: The bUE lets the base station know that it has received the connect message
    Body: None
    Example: (bue_main.py) self.ota.send_ota_message(10, "ACK")
    Response: None

PING:
    Direction: bUE -> base
    Meaning: The bUE periodically pings the base station
    Body: None
    Example: (bue_main.py) self.ota.send_ota_message(10, "PING")
    Response: The base station will respond with a PINGR. If too much time passes between PINGR's, the bUE knows it has become disconnected from the network.

PINGR:
    Direction: base -> bUE
    Meaning: The base station is responding to the PING. If both PING and PINGR occur regularly, the bUE is connected to the base station.
    Body: None
    Example: (bue_main.py) self.ota.send_ota_message(5, "PINGR")
    Response: None

TEST:
    Direction: base -> bUE
    Meaning: The base station sends a UTW test configuration, a file, a start time, and parameters.
    Body: <configuration>.<role>.<starttime>
    Example: (bue_main.py) self.ota.send_ota_message(5, TEST,<file>,<start_time>,<parameters>)
    Response: The bUE will respond with a TESTR, confirming that it has received the test 

FAIL: 
    Direction: bUE -> base
    Meaning: The bUE receieved a TEST from the base station, but there was something wrong with it, and the test will not run
    Body: TBH (possibly the reason why there was a failure)
    Example: (bue_main.py) self.ota.send_ota_message(10, "FAIL:BAD_CONFIG")
    Response: None

CANC:
    Direction: base -> bUE
    Meaning: If the user needs to terminate a test for any reason, they can send this while the bUE is in the test state.
             If the bUE is in any other state it should have no effect
    Body: None
    Example: (base_station_main.py) self.send_ota_message(5, "CANC")
    Response: None (bUE should start sending PINGs again)


PREPR:
    Direction: bUE -> base
    Meaning: The bUE lets the base station know that it has received the UTW test message and confirms the start time
    Body: <starttime>
    Example: (bue_main.py) self.ota.send_ota_message(10, "TESTR:1745004290")
    Response: None

BEGIN:
    Direction: bUE -> base
    Meaning: The bUE lets the base station know that it has begun its UTW test
    Body: None
    Example: (bue_main.py) self.ota.send_ota_message(10, "BEGIN")
    Response: None

UPD:
    Direction: bUE -> base
    Meaning: The bUE sends an update on the UTW test; TBD (could be any time a UTW message is received, or just a periodic update)
    Body: TBD
    Example: (bue_main.py) self.ota.send_ota_message(10, "UPD:<body>")
    Response: None

DONE:
    Direction: bUE -> base
    Meaning: The bUE lets the base station know that it has finished its UTW test; it will now enter the idle state and send pings again.
    Body: None
    Example: (bue_main.py) self.ota.send_ota_message(10, "DONE")
    Response: None

RELOAD:
    Direction: base -> bUE
    Meaning: The base station tells the bUE to restart its bue.service
    Body: None
    Example: (base_station_main.py) self.ota.send_ota_message(10, "RELOAD")
    Response: None

RESTART: 
    Direction: base -> bUE
    Meaning: The base station tells the bUE to completely restart (sudo reboot)
    Body: None
    Example: (base_station_main.py) self.ota.send_ota_message(10, "RESTART")
    Reponse: None
